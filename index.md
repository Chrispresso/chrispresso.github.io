## About
Hey!

I'm Chris and I'm a Firmware Engineer with a love for engineering, programming and coffee. No, not that drip stuff you find at the gas station. I'm talking espresso - hence the name, Chrispresso. I have a deep interest in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Python, and how to use programming to solve cool problems.

## Requests
Want me to discuss something specific? Curious what programming language to start with? Want to know how to get started with ML/AI? If you have an idea for something you would like to see in a post of mine, let me know [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/requests).
